# 2nd-Hack-Nation-Global-AI-Hackathon
## Overview
This project focuses on predicting protein secondary structures (alpha-helix, beta-sheet, coil) from amino acid sequences.
A lightweight, compute-efficient model was developed to deliver competitive accuracy while remaining suitable for limited computational resources.
